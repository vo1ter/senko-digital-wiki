# 🤔 Frequently asked questions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛒 How do I order a VPS server?
Detailed instructions for ordering a VPS server are [available in this article](/client-area/vps-order).

### 🕒 How long does server setup take?
Virtual servers are set up automatically within 120 seconds after payment. In rare cases, e.g. if you have selected Windows as your OS, server installation may take up to 10 minutes, or when a plan is in very high demand, the setup process may take up to 24 hours.

Instantly available dedicated servers are automatically activated within an hour, subject to availability and the OS chosen. We always do our best to activate these as quickly as possible; however, hardware shortages or supplier delays may occasionally delay the process.

Game hosting servers typically take approximately 15 minutes to process after payment.

### 🔎 Can I test latency or check network performance before ordering?
Yes! You can use our Looking Glass at [https://lg.senko.digital](https://lg.senko.digital) to test latency, run network diagnostics, and download speed test files for each of our locations before making a purchase.

### 👤 Is there a minimum contract or commitment period?
No, all of our services are billed on a monthly basis by default, and there is no long-term commitment required. You may cancel your subscription at any time before your next renewal date.

## 🌍 Server Locations & Infrastructure

### 🌐 Where are your servers located?
Our servers are provided in three main locations: **Germany**, **Frankfurt am Main**, **Finland**, **Helsinki** and **the Netherlands**, **Amsterdam**.

### 🏢 Which data centers do you use for your servers? Are they reliable?
For our location in Germany, we utilize Firstcolo's data center facilities in Frankfurt am Main. Firstcolo is known for their powerful infrastructure and excellent connectivity within Central and Western Europe.

In Finland, while the servers are colocated in Hetzner's Helsinki facility, virtual servers are not directly exposed through Hetzner's network. Instead, we use a different upstream provider to be able to provide DDoS protection, as well as ensure optimal performance and reliability for our customers.

In the Netherlands, we utilize Skylink and Nikhef facilities.

### 📍 Can I choose the exact data center or facility?
Great question! At this time, we don't offer a granular choice of individual data centers or facilities. While our current range of locations is limited, we're steadily expanding and regularly adding more locations, while also prefering quality over quantity *wink-wink*

### 🌍 Are your services available globally?
Yes, you can order from anywhere in the world, subject to compliance with applicable export regulations and our own restrictions (e.g. sanctioned countries). Payment options are also available globally.

## 💻 VPS Plans & Resources

### 📈 What is the difference between your VPS lineups?
We typically offer two or three VPS lineups in each location.

- **BUDGET lineup:** Designed for small test environments, simple tasks, personal VPNs, and other workloads that are not demanding and do not require a guaranteed SLA.
- **EP lineup:** The optimal choice for a broad range of tasks, including demanding databases, Docker containers, self-hosted software, and more.
- **RZ9 lineup:** Best suited for users who need maximum single-threaded performance and significantly higher network speeds.

### ⚡ Are VPS resources dedicated or shared?
All VPS resources, such as RAM, storage, and network bandwidth are dedicated to your server. The only exception is CPU, which is provided as shared vCPU. The level of CPU share available to your VPS depends on the specific plan lineup you select, with clear details provided on our website (indicated by the tooltip next to the vCPU count for each plan).

### 📊 Can I change my plan after purchase?
Yes, you can always upgrade your server plan to a more powerful one within the same plan lineup. Plan changes are applied within a couple of minutes and do not require server reinstallation. 

If you need to migrate your server to a different location, please contact support and request the transfer, specifying both the desired location and the new plan name. Make sure the new plan provides at least as much disk space as your current server.

### 🔄 Can I downgrade my plan to a lower tier?
Currently plan downgrades are not supported. If you need to switch to a lower plan, please contact support to discuss options based on your plan, location, and storage requirements. We'll do our best to assist where possible.

### 💽 Can I add more vCPU/RAM/Storage to my existing VPS without upgrading the whole plan?
At this time, resources such as vCPU, RAM, and storage cannot be added individually to an existing VPS. Each of our plans is carefully balanced to ensure fair resource allocation and performance within our infrastructure. To increase resources, you would need to upgrade to a higher plan.

### ⚡ Can I transfer my virtual server between locations?
Yes, you can transfer your virtual server between locations on any of our VPS plans. This process requires manual assistance from our support team and is possible as long as the destination plan's disk size is equal to or larger than your current server's disk.

## 🌐 Networking & IP Addresses

### ℹ️ Do you have your own ASN?

Yes, we use our own autonomous system, [AS213520](https://as213520.net), registered with RIPE, for all VPS, dedicated server and game hosting services. This gives us full control to manage and optimize our network independently.

### ⚡ Is IPv6 supported?
Yes, all our VPS plans come with a on-link /64 IPv6 subnet by default.

### 📡 Can I buy additional IP addresses?
Yes, you can purchase up to 16 additional IPv4 addresses per VPS server. The cost is €1.5 per month for each IPv4 address. Please note that additional IPs are not available for BUDGET lineup plans due to plan limitations.

### 📡 Do you offer IP replacements?
Yes, you can request one free IPv4 address replacement per VPS server, provided you have a valid reason. Any additional replacements are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and may incur a fee of €5 per IPv4 address. This policy is in place to prevent abuse.

### 📡 Can I get a IPv6 block larger than /64 for my VPS?
Currently, it is not possible to assign IPv6 blocks larger than a /64 per VPS. However, this may become available as a paid option in the future, provided you have a valid technical reason for requiring a larger allocation.

### 🧰 Do you offer IPv6-only VPS?
At this time, we do not offer IPv6-only VPS plans. All of our current VPS offerings include both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity by default.

If this is a feature you are interested in, please let us know - customer demand will help guide our priorities.

### 🌐 Do you offer IPv4 NAT or shared IPv4 plans?
No, all VPS come with dedicated IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. We currently do not offer NAT or shared IP plans.

### 🌐 Are any ports initially restricted on VPS servers?
To help protect our IP addresses and maintain network integrity, outbound port 25 (SMTP) is initially blocked on all VPS plans.

For the `BUDGET-1`, `BUDGET-2`, `BUDGET-3`, and `BUDGET-4` plans, these ports cannot be opened under any circumstances in any of the locations.

For all other plans, you may request the opening of ports 25 and/or 465 by submitting a support request via your client area. Please note that we will review the intended use as part of our verification process prior to approving such requests.

### 📡 Do you support rDNS / PTR records?
Yes, we support rDNS/PTR records management on all of our plans except for the BUDGET lineup. Customers can configure and update rDNS for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses directly through our VM control panel at any time.

### 🌐 Can I point my own domain to your VPS?
Yes! You can point any domain you own to our VPS and manage DNS settings via our panel or your domain registrar's control panel. We also offer DNS record management for all virtual servers except BUDGET plans.

### 🌐 Do you provide BGP sessions?
At this time, we are unable to offer BGP sessions from our AS due to current network topology constraints. However, we are actively working on adding this capability and expect to make BGP sessions available for everyone in the near future.

### 🚦 Do you throttle or limit bandwidth during peak hours?
There is no artificial throttling of bandwidth during peak hours. Your bandwidth and network performance are determined by your plan's parameters and current network conditions, as well as whether your service has went over the traffic allocation.

## 🖥️ Operating Systems & Software

### 🔧 What operating systems do you support?
We support a wide range of operating systems including:

Linux distributions:
- Debian (11 Bullseye, 12 Bookworm, 13 Trixie)
- Ubuntu (22.04 Jammy, 24.04 Noble, 26.04 Resolute)
- AlmaLinux (8, 9, 10)
- CentOS (8 Stream, 9 Stream)
- Oracle Linux (8, 9)

Other operating systems:
- Windows (10, 11, Server 2016/2022/2025)
- FreeBSD (13, 14)

We also support custom ISO uploads with up to 10 GB in size (except for BUDGET plans).

### 🖥️ Do you support Windows licensing?
We do not provide operating system licenses and are not a Microsoft partner (yet). If you wish to use Windows on your server, you must supply your own valid license (BYOL - Bring Your Own License). Our virtual and dedicated servers fully support customer-supplied Windows licenses.

### 📦 Do your VPS plans come with pre-installed software?
All VPS plans are delivered as clean installations of the operating system you choose. We do not install additional software or control panels by default, but you may install any supported software on your server after deployment.

### 🧑‍🔬 Do you support software licensing (cPanel, DirectAdmin, Plesk, etc.)?
We do not directly sell software licenses at this time. However, if you wish to use cPanel, DirectAdmin, Plesk, or other licensed software, you can bring your own license or purchase one from an authorized reseller. These panels are fully compatible with our infrastructure.

### ⚙️ What virtualization technology do you use?
All of our virtual servers use KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) virtualization technology. KVM enables robust isolation between customers, ensuring strong security, reliable performance, and hardware-level virtualization features. This approach allows each VPS to function like a separate, fully independent server with its own resources.

### 🧑‍💻 Do you allow virtualization inside VPS (nested virtualization)?
At this time, nested virtualization is enabled only on our DE-RZ9 and DE-STORAGE plan lineups. This restriction exists because nested virtualization significantly increases CPU load, causes issues with live migrations, and therefore is not supported on other lineups for performance and stability reasons.

## 💾 Backups & Data Management

### 🔄 Do you offer backup services?
Yes, we provide backup solutions for all of our VPS plans. For most of the plans backups are included free of charge. Additional backup storage can be purchased separately. Find out more [here](/vps/how-to-create-a-backup).

### 🔒 Where are VM backups stored?
Our backup storage is located in a different datacenter from the VM nodes. This provides additional redundancy and helps ensure that your backups remain safe even if there is an issue at the main site.

### 💾 Can I restore backups myself?
For plans where backup snapshots are included, you can restore available backups directly from the control panel, choosing from previous recovery points as needed (excluding BUDGET plans). If you experience issues, please reach out to support.

### ❓ How long will my data be stored if my service gets suspended?
If your service is suspended due to non-payment, your server's data will be stored for up to 7 days. After this period, the server and all associated data will be automatically deleted from our systems.

### 📁 Can I request raw disk or VM images of my server?
If you need a raw disk or VM image for migration or backup, contact support. We can assist with exporting your VM image in most cases, though processing times and limitations may apply.

## 🎮 Control Panel & Management

### 🔐 What functions does the VM panel offer?
We offer a VM control panel that allows you to:
- Manage power states (start/stop/restart)
- Access console
- Monitor resource usage
- Manage DNS records
- Configure reverse DNS
- Install/reinstall OS
- Manage backups
- View network statistics

### 📋 Can I automate server management with an API?
Yes, we currently allow API access to both the Client Area and the VM control panel for automating server management and related tasks. For API documentation and detailed instructions, please contact our team, who will provide you with all the relevant information you need.

### 👨‍🔧 Can I access the server console if I lose network access?
Yes, you can access your VM's out-of-band (VNC) console via our control panel, allowing you to troubleshoot and regain access even if standard network connectivity is disrupted.

### 📝 Can I add notes or labels to my VPS in the control panel?
Yes, you can assign custom labels or notes to your VPS via the control panel for easy identification and management, especially if you have multiple servers.

### ⏸️ Can I schedule an auto-shutdown or auto-reboot for my servers?
At this time, built-in scheduling features are not included in the control panel. However, you can set up custom cron jobs or scripts directly within your server to handle automated shutdowns, reboots, and other actions as required.

### 🔄 Can I schedule automatic server reinstallations?
Automatic reinstallation scheduling is not currently available. Manual OS reinstalls can be performed anytime via the control panel.

### 🛑 Can I suspend or pause my server/service temporarily?
There is currently no built-in "pause" function for services. If you wish to suspend your service to avoid billing, you must cancel it through our support and order it again later. Back up all data before cancellation.

## 💳 Payment & Billing

### 💵 What payment methods are available?
We support more than 20 different payment methods, including debit and credit cards, such as **Visa**, **MasterCard**, and **American Express**, as well as electronic payment networks like **PayPal** and **Alipay**.

## 🛡️ Security & DDoS Protection

### 🛡️ Do you offer any DDoS protection?
In Germany, we provide basic Layer 3 and Layer 4 DDoS protection for all services. We are actively working on expanding our protection capabilities. In the near future we will be able to offer a paid add-on for VPS servers, which will allow our customers to create custom protection rules and view attack statistics.

We also offer basic Layer 3 and Layer 4 DDoS protection in Finland and the Netherlands, however we do not have any plans on providing DDoS rule management capabilities in the near future.

### 🛡 Do you provide a DDoS protection panel?
Currently, we do not provide a dedicated DDoS protection management panel. However, we are in the process of integrating our DDoS protection solutions in our Germany location. We also plan to introduce DDoS management capabilities through our new Client Area in the near future.

### 🛡️ What security measures are in place to protect my data?
Our infrastructure is protected by state-of-the-art firewalls, regular security audits, 24/7 monitoring, and access is limited to authorized personnel only. Backup data is stored separately in secure environments to maximize safety.

### 🚨 How can I report abuse (spam, attacks, DMCA, etc.) from your IPs?
Please email your abuse reports (including all relevant logs and evidence) to [abuse@senko.digital](mailto:abuse@senko.digital). We support the [XARF](https://xarf.org/) abuse report format and strongly prefer reports to be submitted using XARF whenever possible, as it enables us to process your request more efficiently.

Our abuse team investigates each case promptly and will follow up as required by law and best practices.

### 🌩️ What happens if there is a DDoS attack on another customer?
