# Deploying Node.js Application on VPS with PM2

In this guide, we'll cover the process of deploying a Node.js application on a VPS server using the PM2 process manager to ensure reliability, automatic restart, and application scaling.

## What is PM2 and why you should use it

PM2 (Process Manager 2) is an advanced process manager for Node.js applications that provides:

- Automatic restart when an application crashes
- Load balancing through clustering
- Real-time process monitoring
- Log management
- Automatic startup on system boot
- Zero-downtime deployment

## Prerequisites

- VPS server with Linux (Ubuntu 24 is used as an example)
- Root access
- Basic knowledge of Linux command line
- Node.js project ready for deployment

## Installing Node.js and npm

First, let's install Node.js and npm using NVM (Node Version Manager), which allows you to easily switch between different Node.js versions.

```bash
# Install curl if you don't have it
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl

# Install NVM
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.2/install.sh | bash

source ~/.bashrc

# Check if NVM was successfully installed
nvm --version

# Install the latest LTS version of Node.js
nvm install --lts

# Check Node.js and npm versions
node --version
npm --version
```

::: tip
It's recommended to use LTS (Long Term Support) versions of Node.js for mission-critical applications, as these versions provide long-term support and stability.
:::

## Installing PM2

Let's install PM2 globally for convenience:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

## Preparing the Node.js Application

### Cloning the project from a repository

Clone your project from a Git repository or upload it to the server manually:

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/username/your-project.git
cd your-project

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Configuring and launching the application with PM2

### Basic launch

The simplest way to start an application with PM2:

```bash
pm2 start app.js --name "my-app"
```

Where `my-app` is the name of your application, which you'll use to refer to PM2 for further management.

### Launching in cluster mode

To use multiple CPU cores and ensure high availability, you can use the following command:

```bash
# Automatically creates the optimal number of processes depending on the number of CPU cores
pm2 start app.js --name "my-app" -i max
```

Note: your application must support clustering.

### Creating a PM2 configuration file

For more detailed configuration, let's create an `ecosystem.config.js` file:

```bash
cat > ecosystem.config.js << 'EOL'
module.exports = {
  apps: [{
    name: "my-app",
    script: "app.js",
    instances: "max",
    exec_mode: "cluster",
    autorestart: true,
    watch: false,
    max_memory_restart: "200M",
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: "development",
    },
    env_production: {
      NODE_ENV: "production",
      PORT: 3000
    }
  }]
}
EOL
```

Starting the application using the configuration file:

```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production
```

## Configuring PM2 autostart on server reboot

To make your application start automatically when the server reboots, run the following command:

```bash
pm2 startup
```

Execute the command that PM2 displays in the console.

Then save the current list of processes:

```bash
pm2 save
```

Now your application(s) will start even after server reboot without manual intervention.

## Setting up Nginx as a reverse proxy

To provide public access to your application (for example, through a domain), you need to configure Nginx:

```bash
# Install Nginx
sudo apt install nginx

# Create a site configuration
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/my-app
```

Add the following configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com www.your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Activate the configuration and restart Nginx:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/my-app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

::: tip
After configuring Nginx, it's recommended to set up an SSL certificate using Let's Encrypt for secure connections. Instructions can be found in our [Let's Encrypt setup article](/software/letsencrypt-ssl).

## Basic PM2 commands

### Process monitoring

```bash
# Real-time monitoring
pm2 monit

# View the process list
pm2 list

# Detailed information about a process
pm2 show my-app
```

### Process management

```bash
# Restart the application
pm2 restart my-app

# Stop the application
pm2 stop my-app

# Remove the process from the PM2 list
pm2 delete my-app
```

### Working with logs

```bash
# View general logs from all applications
pm2 logs

# View logs for a specific application
pm2 logs my-app

# View the last 200 lines of logs
pm2 logs --lines 200
```

## Updating the application without downtime (Zero-Downtime Deployment)

To update the application without interrupting its operation:

1. Update the code (e.g., through git pull)
2. Perform an application reload:

```bash
pm2 reload my-app
```

## Monitoring and statistics

PM2 provides basic free monitoring, but for mission-critical applications, it's recommended to set up more advanced monitoring:

### PM2 Plus (paid solution)

```bash
pm2 plus
```

### Integration with Prometheus + Grafana

Install pm2-prometheus:

```bash
npm install -g pm2-prometheus
pm2 install pm2-prometheus
```

Then configure Prometheus to collect metrics from the `/metrics` endpoint and Grafana for data visualization.

## Troubleshooting

### Application won't start

Check the logs:

```bash
pm2 logs my-app
```

Common causes of problems:

- Errors in the application code
- Port already in use
- Insufficient file access permissions
- Dependencies not installed

### Application crashes under high load

- Check memory usage: `pm2 monit`
- Consider increasing the memory limit in the configuration
- Consider scaling the application across multiple servers
- Upgrade your server plan if resources are insufficient

### Problem: PM2 doesn't restart after server reboot

Reconfigure autostart:

```bash
pm2 unstartup
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

## Conclusion
